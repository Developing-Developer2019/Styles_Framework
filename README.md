# Styles Framework

I create a lot of projects offline and always waste alot of time in defining different styles, or combatting Bootstrap and other frameworks for my own right in designing my projects.

This is my framework I will be using here on out for projects, with a component based system for pick and choose media that I require for my project.

When starting the framework to make edits, start terminal <strong>"npm run build"</strong> to run compiler and minifier to intergrate it to the CSS file.

(Also run npm install to get packages needed)
